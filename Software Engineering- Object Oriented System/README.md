In this Java Code, I implement an Object-Oriented System for Barabershop Management by Barbershop employees.


   Employees can add customers to the system, delete and sort by name or service. Additionally, They can manage thier barbershop day, add services, etc.

-How to run the code?


In order to run the code, open the file: BarberShopHomePageGUI found in Package: BarberShopGUI.

All the backgrounds and images that appear in the UI will only work if they are in the path that appears in the code.

There is a file called servicelist.txt in which there is a list of treatments of the hairdresser,
and it will also appear correctly only if it is loaded according to the path saved in the code.

Enjoy!
