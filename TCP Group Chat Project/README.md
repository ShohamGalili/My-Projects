# TCP Group Chat Application

Welcome to the TCP Group Chat Application! This project demonstrates how to create a group chat environment using TCP sockets and threading.

## Features

1. **Create Group Chats:**
   - Users can create their own group chat rooms.

2. **Join Existing Groups:**
   - New clients can join an existing group chat if they have the correct group name and ID.

3. **Disconnect and Leave Groups:**
   - Clients can disconnect from the server and leave the group chat whenever they wish.

## Getting Started

### 1. Run the Server

To start using the application, you first need to run the server. This will allow clients to connect and create or join group chats.

- Open the server code file and execute it to start the server.

### 2. Launch Clients

Once the server is running, you can launch multiple client instances. Each client can connect to the server, create or join group chats, and participate in discussions.

- Open the client code file and execute it to start a new client.

### 3. Connect and Chat

- **To Create a Group Chat:** Follow the instructions provided in the client interface to create a new group chat.
- **To Join an Existing Group Chat:** Enter the group name and ID when prompted.
- **To Disconnect:** Use the provided option in the client interface to leave the group chat and disconnect from the server.

## Notes

- Ensure that the server is running before starting the clients.
- Multiple clients can join the same group chat as long as they have the correct group name and ID.
