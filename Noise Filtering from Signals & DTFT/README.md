# Noise Filtering from Speech Signals

Welcome to the Noise Filtering Project! This exercise demonstrates how to apply mathematical principles to real-world problems, specifically focusing on filtering noise from speech signals using discrete-time signals.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Fourier Transform Implementation:**
   - In this section, I implemented a function to perform a Fourier transform on the speech signal. This allows us to analyze the frequency components of the signal, which is crucial for effective noise filtering.

2. **Noise Filtering with Three Different Filters:**
   - I developed and applied three different filters to remove noise from the speech signal. Each filter has been designed with specific characteristics to optimize noise reduction while preserving the quality of the speech.
   - Additionally, I compared these filters based on:
     - **Noise Attenuation Quality:** How effectively each filter reduces noise.
     - **Speech Preservation:** How well the desired speech is retained without distortion.
     - **Computational Efficiency:** The number of calculations (multiplications) required to produce the output.

## How to Use

1. **Fourier Transform:**
   - Use the provided function to perform a Fourier transform on your input signal.

2. **Apply Filters:**
   - Experiment with the three different filters to clean your speech signal from noise.

3. **Compare Results:**
   - Review the comparison of the filters to understand the trade-offs between noise attenuation, speech quality preservation, and computational efficiency.

## Conclusion

This project provides a practical approach to understanding and implementing noise filtering techniques in speech processing. It's a great way to see the direct impact of mathematical concepts on real-world audio signals.
