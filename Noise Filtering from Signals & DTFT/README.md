The purpose of the exercise is to implement the mathematical principles for real problems of noise filtering from speech signals,
Used discrete time signals.

In the first part×ª I implemented a function to perform a Fourier transform.
In the second part, I implemented 3 different filters to filter the noise from the signal.
Additionaly I made a comparison of the different filters in terms of the quality of the noise attenuation,
the preservation of the desired speech without distortion and a number of calculations (multiplications) for the output production.
